Q: Can you think of an analogy between the process of tesselating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways? 
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?

A:
The hexagon represents a part or section of the world. The tesselation is the union of these hexagons.

Q: If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tesselating hexagons.

A:
I would write a recursive generation that would work on a tile for neighbors. Then, I would use a method to find a layout for them.
-----
Q: What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?

A:
Hallways take you to rooms and rooms are where you can stay and things are. Hallways and rooms both have walls and are indoors.

Q: For tesselating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way. 
After looking at your own implemention, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab. 
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?

A:
I did not get to even start, but it showed me a lot about how algorithms are derived and understood.
-----
Q: Consider an algorithm for placing rooms and hallways on your map. 
Ideally, consider many algorithms and think about what makes some easier or harder to implement. Try and bring those ideas together into a single simple algorithm which accomplishes the task. 
In general, algorithms with as few edge cases as possible are better algorithms.

A:
Hallways can go along the edges of the hexagon and rooms can go in the hexagon.
