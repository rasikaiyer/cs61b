All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A:

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I felt proud of implementing the circular array deque, specifically figuring out where the first element was and how to loop through the array.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I felt that there was a lot of repetitive code, so I could've written more private functions to avoid that, but just copied and pasted code instead.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would fix the inelegance and write several functions with specific parameters to take out the repetitive code.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A:

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I'm proud of how I implemented getRecursive -- using a method I wrote in the helper class. I thought the solution, although not very unique, was clever and refined.
